# Simon Game 

## Challenge: To Use JavaScript and jQuery to create the game Simon where a player has to mimic the pattern exactly, one misstep and it's Game Over

## Developer Challenges:
### - Generating the random color was tricky at first.  I had to connect the random number to the index of the color array to make a random color pattern. I used JS for this part.
### - The next challenge was getting the flash animation.  A little StackOverflow and testing helped my solution.
### - Connecting the sound to the color, I used JS for this.  I explored creating a new Audio object, and used the play() method to start the playback of the associated audio file.
